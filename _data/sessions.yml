  title: "Building APIs for an unreliable world"
  description: "Networks and computing systems are unreliable. Connections drop or slow to
    a crawl. Hard drives break and systems turn off without warning. These
    issues affect public and private APIs alike, but can spell disaster for
    microservices, as unreliability can lead to inconsistency.

    In this talk, we will explore strategies for designing APIs that can help
    mitigate unreliability. We will look at how the details of an implementation
    can influence resilience. Finally, we will see how design and implementation
    influence each other for creating an API that is best suited to tackle
    unreliability."

  title: "More than colors and whitespaces – designing enterprise applications"
  description: "Designing good applications is complex, involves analytical and creative thinking, as well as a lot of tedious, but necessary work. Defining a design language that cares about end users and empowers designers to create appealing and intuitive apps – while covering business needs and ensuring consistency – is a major challenge. We will share our insights and best practices based on our own journey."

  title: "The Future of Front-End Performance"
  description: "Help! My app bundle is 5MB! My users are angry that my app is so slow! It’s easy to forget that performance matters when we are under pressure to deliver features quickly. We will talk about bleeding-edge topics in front-end performance such as dual-bundles for modern browser transpiling, hijacking download/parse/compile/execute time, and not blocking the main thread. Come learn how to deliver better user experience with high-performing front-end apps using Webpack. This talk is library-agnostic (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)"

  title: "Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad"
  description: "Software development has regularly borrowed processes and terminology from outside technology to improve how code gets to customers. For example, Scrum comes from rugby, and sprints come from track and field. However, history has been an often neglected source of insight for software development. The Underground Railroad was a system of pathways and people that provided a way for African-American slaves to escape to non-slave states and countries such as Canada and Mexico. The network stretched from Boston to Austin and consisted of self-organizing teams operating in conditions of extreme uncertainty who were tasked with shipping the most important product of all: freedom.

    The Underground Railroad provides insights that technical leaders can use to improve their teams, products, and customer relationships. This talk will share timeless lessons of courage and leadership from the men and women who risked everything for the success of their teams."

  title: "Story telling with Git rebase"
  description: "In a successful software development project, a key challenge is to manage complexity because projects get very complex very quickly even within small teams. Version control is the tool for communicating intent in our codebase over the life time of the project. Rebasing allows us to revise our development history before sharing it with the team.

    Learn to use Git commit messages to keep track of the intent of your code changes to make it easier to make future changes. Learn how to make using feature branches less painful and more effective. Learn the mechanics of interactive rebasing, how to merge conflicts without losing precious code and how to auto-squash commits. Basically, stop fearing interactive rebasing."

  title: "A stateless stateful service for cooperative filtering in Node.js"
  description: "|
    In a world dominated by R, Python and Scala, Node.js is commonly seen as incapable of performing the work required by recommendation engines. Netflix has challenged bright minds for many years to find the best collaborative filtering algorithm and many other companies developed powerful systems like Apache Spark. Is it possible to achieve the similar results but using a more lightweight and commonly-known language like Javascript? Philip II of Macedon defined 'Divide et Impera' as the strategy of success in politics and sociology. Applying the same principle to this problem, takes us to how to distribute and coordinate AI computations."

  description: "You’ve made your first app, or maybe you’ve even been working with Angular for the past year now. Still, there’s something missing and you can’t put your finger on… How can you take your applications to the next level? What’s this lazy loading I hear about? Do I really have to subscribe to all my Observables? Man, how can I make my apps run faster? That’s ok, we’re going to drop some major KEYS to building your apps. Now that you’ve made a few components, have gotten routing figured out in your apps, it’s time to step up your ng-game! Learn about the best practices and ways to make fast and large Angular applications like a pro."

  title: "The how's and why's of flexible React components"
  description: "Building React components is simple — until it isn’t. Real world constraints can lead to large components that 'do it all'. Or near identical components with one or two changes. So how do we create flexible components without sacrificing readability and scalability? Jenn shares how she re-architected components to handle multiple use cases and increase engineer happiness. She’ll breakdown the technical concerns for each component, the patterns she considered using, what didn’t work and what did. You’ll learn more than the 'how' of component architecture – you’ll learn the 'why'!"
