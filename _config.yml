aboutBlock:
 - {title: "Diversity & Inclusion", image: "conference.jpg", text: "#fstoco is organized by a diverse group of individuals, and seeks to have a diverse line-up of speakers. We make sure that our event is a safe space for learning including gender non-binary washrooms and an enforced code of conduct. We also take great pride in attracting attendees from all around the world. Toronto is diverse and so should it’s leading tech event!" }
 - {title: "Curated Content", image: "hackathon.jpg", text: "Our planning process starts with great quality content, we carefully select topics that you can go right back to work and start integrating into your existing stack. Those topics are laid out in the schedule so you get exposed to more than just your specialization and stack, then find amazing speakers to talk in those spots. This is a lot different than the traditional CFP process." }
 - {title: "Networking", image: "workshop.jpg", text: "We design our networking around breaking down barriers. We offer you a space on your name tag to put your passion so someone else can make that first intro, we’ve put games, lego, and other icebreakers around the venue so you can come together over a common task to feel less interrogated and a mix of designers and developers at the event spurs amazing conversations!" }

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
